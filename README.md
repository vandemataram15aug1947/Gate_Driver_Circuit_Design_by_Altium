# 🔌 Gate_Driver_Circuit_Design_by_Altium

This repository contains the complete design files for a **Gate Driver Circuit**, created using **Altium Designer**. Gate drivers are essential components in power electronics systems, used to interface low-power control signals from a microcontroller or DSP (like TMS320F28379D) to high-power semiconductor switches such as **MOSFETs** or **IGBTs**.

## 📘 Overview

The gate driver circuit serves the following primary purposes:

- **Voltage Level Shifting**: Converts logic-level signals (3.3V/5V) to gate drive levels (10V–15V).
- **Current Amplification**: Provides sufficient gate current for fast switching transitions.
- **Electrical Isolation**: Protects the controller by isolating high-power and low-power sections using opto-isolators or transformers.
- **Safety & Protection**: Features such as undervoltage lockout (UVLO), desaturation detection, and dead-time control ensure safe operation.

This design is ideal for applications requiring robust and reliable gate driving capability, particularly in the fields of **motor control**, **inverters**, **DC-DC converters**, and **power supplies**.
